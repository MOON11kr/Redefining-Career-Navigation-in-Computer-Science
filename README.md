# 🎓 Career Clarity in Computer Science  
_A Mixed-Methods Student-Led Study Integrating Peer Data and Industry Insights_

## 🌱 Inspiration

This project began with a personal observation. My younger brother, in Class 10, was overwhelmed by the pressure of choosing between science, commerce, and arts. Surrounded by opinions but lacking real-world insights, he had no clear way of understanding what these paths actually looked like in practice.

As a Computer Science undergraduate myself, I reflected on how common this confusion is — even at the university level. Many students complete an entire degree in CS without fully understanding their options, potential career paths, or the skillsets needed to succeed in specific domains like AI, cybersecurity, fintech, biotech, or software development.

This project was born out of a desire to bridge that gap — to make real career guidance accessible, actionable, and grounded in voices from the industry itself.

## 📌 Overview

This is a mixed-method research and documentation project aimed at addressing **career confusion among CS students**. It involves:

- 📊 **Quantitative data** from CS students about their aspirations, fears, and interests
- 🎥 **Video interviews** with professionals from diverse CS-related domains
- 🧠 **Analysis and synthesis** to map confusion, identify awareness gaps, and offer structured clarity
- 📚 **Documentation** of the full process to support research, replication, and further study

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the types and causes of career confusion among undergraduate CS students
- Capture real-world insights from working professionals across different tech fields
- Provide early-stage students with accurate, relatable guidance
- Propose actionable strategies for academic institutions and students themselves
